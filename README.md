Hello, my name is RaphaÃ«l. I am a French student in Reims, France, currently
studying for a engineering degree in computer science, specialized in embedded system
development.
This repository stores all my linux configuration files that I wish to keep.

Feel free to browse the files for inspiration to configure a particular program. I personally
wouldn't recommend to blindly copy stuff from this configuration, as it will likely be a pain
to get working. Besides, what would be the fun in that ?

## Setup

### Hardware

I have 2 machines...

### OS

I currently run ArchLinux on both computers, and do not plan on changing anytime soon.
I do keep an eye on NixOS though, which I've tried with mitigated success to set up in the past.

### Desktop environment

### Development environment

### Dotfile management strategy
